SANS SEC301: Introduction to Cyber Security
You Will Be Able To
Communicate with confidence regarding information security topics, terms, and concepts
Understand and apply the Principles of Least Privilege
Understand and apply the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) for prioritization of critical security resources
Build better passwords that are more secure while also being easier to remember and type
Grasp basic cryptographic principles, processes, procedures, and applications
Understand how a computer works
Understand computer network basics
Have a fundamental grasp of any number of technical acronyms: TCP/IP, IP, TCP, UDP, MAC, ARP, NAT, ICMP, and DNS, and the list goes on.
Utilize built-in Windows tools to see your network settings
Recognize and be able to discuss various security technologies, including anti-malware, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, sniffers, ethical hacking, active defense, and threat hunting.
Understand wireless technologies including WiFi, Bluetooth, mobile phones and the Internet of Things (IoT)
Explain a variety of frequent attacks such as social engineering, drive-by downloads, watering hole attacks, lateral movement, and other attacks
Understand different types of malware
Understand browser security and the privacy issues associated with web browsing
Explain system hardening
Discuss system patching
Understand virtual machines and cloud computing
Understand backups and create a backup plan for your personal life that virtually guarantees you never have to pay ransom to access your data
SANS SEC401: Security Essentials: Network, Endpoint, and Cloud
You will learn (applied to on-premise and in the Cloud)
The core areas of cybersecurity and how to create a security program that is built on a foundation of Detection, Response, and Prevention
Practical tips and tricks that focus on addressing high-priority security problems within your organization and doing the right things that lead to security solutions that work
How adversaries adapt tactics and techniques, and importantly how to adapt your defense accordingly
What ransomware is and how to better defend against it
How to leverage a defensible network architecture (VLANs, NAC, and 802.1x) based on advanced persistent threat indicators of compromise
The Identity and Access Management (IAM) methodology, including aspects of strong authentication (Multi-Factor Authentication)
How to leverage the strengths and differences among the top three cloud providers (Amazon, Microsoft, and Google), including the concepts of multi-cloud
How to identify visible weaknesses of a system using various tools and, once vulnerabilities are discovered, configure the system to be more secure (realistic and practical application of a capable vulnerability management program)
How to sniff network communication protocols to determine the content of network communication (including access credentials) using tools such as tcpdump and Wireshark
How to use Windows, Linux, and macOS command line tools to analyze a system looking for high-risk indicators of compromise, as well as the concepts of basic scripting for the automation of continuous monitoring
How to build a network visibility map that can be used to validate the attack surface and determine the best methodology to reduce the attack surface through hardening and configuration management
Why some organizations win and why some lose when it comes to security, and most importantly, how to be on the winning side
